# üçΩ  Foodie  üçΩ 

During my Javascript Development bootcamp this was my final project submission. My course helped me learn the basics knowledge of Javascript by using funcitons, API's, and also jquery. The assignment was to use any api of our choosing and linking it to a google cloud firestore database. I do acknowledge that this project is behind on the current version of react.

**Update**
After a few years I went to revisit how much I have learned in the past 2 years. I realized that the file structure of this project needed attention and the styling needed a refresh.
As well other imrovements and even added some modern touches.
